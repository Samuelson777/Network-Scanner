## Conclusion
The Network Scanner project provides a practical introduction to network programming and packet manipulation using Python and the Scapy library. By implementing this project, you have learned how to send ARP requests to discover devices on a local network, retrieve their IP and MAC addresses, and display this information in a user-friendly format. This foundational knowledge is essential for understanding network communications and can serve as a stepping stone for more advanced networking projects.

## Future Enhancements
- **Device Manufacturer Identification**: Enhance the project by using the MAC address to identify the manufacturer of each device.

- **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: Create a GUI using libraries like Tkinter or PyQt to make the application more user-friendly.

- **Exporting Results**: Implement functionality to export the scan results to a file format such as CSV or JSON.

- **Network Mapping**: Extend the project to create a visual representation of the network topology.

- **Port Scanning**: Add a feature to perform port scanning on discovered devices to check for open ports and services.

- **Scheduled Scans**: Implement a feature to schedule regular scans of the network.

- **Integration with Other Tools**: Integrate the network scanner with other network analysis tools or frameworks.

- **Security Features**: Add features to detect unauthorized devices on the network or alert users about potential security risks.
